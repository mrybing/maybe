2. GAZE & EXPRESSION: Where they look, facial expression (e.g. "looking down at phone with relaxed half-smile" or "eyes closed, chin slightly lifted, serene expression")
3. PRODUCT INTERACTION: How they physically relate to the product (e.g. "right hand gently touching the earbud on left ear")
4. SPATIAL POSITION: Where in the frame, distance from camera, relationship to other models (e.g. "foreground left third, 2m from camera, facing toward MODEL_B in center")
Example of GOOD model direction:
"{{MODEL_A}} stands in the left third of the frame, weight shifted to her right hip, left hand casually holding a coffee cup at waist level, head tilted slightly right with a warm, candid smile, the {{PRODUCT}} visible on her right ear catching the rim light. {{MODEL_B}} sits on the concrete ledge in the right third, one knee drawn up, scrolling through phone with earbuds in, relaxed posture, looking down at screen with a focused but calm expression."
Example of BAD model direction (too vague):
"{{MODEL_A}} is on the left side looking stylish. {{MODEL_B}} is on the right using the product."

3. PRODUCT INTERACTION: How they physically relate to the product (e.g. "right hand lightly touching earbud, fingers curved around ear")

Example of GOOD: "{{MODEL_A}} mid-stride on a rain-slicked sidewalk, weight on left foot pushing off, right arm swinging naturally, head turned slightly right with a determined grin, the {{PRODUCT}} snug on both ears with the matte casing catching street-lamp glow."
